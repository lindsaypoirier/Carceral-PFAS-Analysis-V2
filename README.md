# Carceral PFAS Analysis

## About

The code and data in this repo calculates the number, percentages, and populations of US carceral facilities in the same HUC-12 watershed boundary and, as a proxy for hydrologic flow, at a lower elevation than point sources with likely PFAS contamination.

## Repo Architecture

There are several R Markdown files in this repo:

1. `get_HUC_elevation.Rmd`
  * Imports source datasets and transforms them to a common CRS (4269)
  * Calculates the total facilities under consideration each category
  * Determines which watershed boundary (HUC-12) each facility in the source datasets geo-spatially intersect with
  * Determines the elevation of each facility in the source datasets via the USGS Elevation Point Query Service
  * Saves the resulting data as .gpkg files for use in `HUC_analysis.Rmd`
  
2. `HUC_analysis.Rmd`
  * Loads the .gpkg files created in get_HUC_elevation.Rmd
  * Joins carceral facility data to data representing the locations of each potential point source based on a shared HUC-12 code
  * Filters to carceral facilities at a lower elevation than a potential point source as a proxy for hydrological flow direction
  * Calculates the number of unique facilities in the same HUC-12 watershed boundary and at a lower elevation than each point source and a combination of point sources, along with the number of incarcerated people potentially impacted
  * Disaggregates the results by source of contamination, type of carceral facility, whether or not the facility is a juvenile facility, and whether or not the facility is in an urban census block
  
3. `hospitals_analysis.Rmd`, `nursing_homes_analysis.Rmd`, `schools_analysis.Rmd`
  * Repeats most of the calculations performed in `HUC_analysis.Rmd`, swapping out carceral facilities with other types of facilities

4. `carceral_analysis_plots.Rmd`
  * Produces the plots presented in the manuscript, along with a number of other plots
  
5. `carceral_statistical_tests.Rmd`
  * Performs a permutation test to determine whether juvenile carceral facilities may be under-prioritized for PFAS testing
  * Performs a two-proportion z-test to determine whether industrial PFAS sites are under-tested in comparison to other types of PFAS sites

Source and cleaned data files may be made available upon request.

All of the .gpkg files created for this project are available in the `huc_elevation_datasets` folder in this repo, so the code in `carceral_analysis.Rmd` can be run without running the code in `get_HUC_elevation.Rmd`. Note that `get_HUC_elevation.Rmd` involves a number of API calls to the USGS Elevation Point Query Service. 

## Notes

* As of 2020, US facilities were required to report certain PFAS emissions via the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). In 2022 year 47 facilities reported PFAS emissions to the TRI. We looked into these facilities, and the changes to the results of the analysis were negligible. We opted to exclude this category based on concerns that the novelty of this reporting requirement was resulting in dramatic under-estimations of the total emitted PFAS. See `HUC_analysis_with_TRI.Rmd` for more information. 
* Carceral facilities reported by HIFLD are missing a number of private and ICE facilities. Population data is also missing for about 29% of these facilities.
